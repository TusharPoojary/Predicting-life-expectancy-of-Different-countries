# Predicting life expectancy of different countries

The Global Health Observatory (GHO) data repository under World Health Organization (WHO) keeps track of the health status as well as many other related factors for all countries The data-sets are made available to public for the purpose of health data analysis. In this project we have considered data from year 2000-2015 for 193 countries for further analysis.

This study will focus on immunization factors, mortality factors, economic factors, social factors and other health related factors as well. Since the observations this dataset are based on different countries, it will be easier for a country to determine the predicting factor which is contributing to lower value of life expectancy. This will help in suggesting a country which area should be given importance in order to efficiently improve the life expectancy of its population.

First we start with data cleaning by detecting and removing null-values and treating outliers. Then we move to Data Exploration and Feature Engineering.
